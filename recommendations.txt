Feedback:


(1) Antivirus - Unless I'm mistaken, Dekekt is specifically designed to
detect only a few specific pieces of malware, and that folks who are
less technically familiar with virii should use something in addition.
Winodws Security Essentials for Windows is free and about as adequate
as any other paid service.

(2) Truecrypt/Ciphersecure is not an Operating System

(3) Recommending CACert is disingenuous as it is not in any trust stores,
so you'll get certificate errors.  Let's Encrypt is not available yet.
Just about any CA is equivaltnt o any other - at the level of people
who don't know what a 'CA' is, they compete on price, not features.

(4) Onionshare does not do cloud backup

add Peersm [1], [2]

This is not "only" a js Tor bittorrent inside browsers for streaming/download, people can exchange whatever content and encrypt it personnaly on top of the Tor protocol encryption.

Prism-break did not include it because the code is not open source for now (see discussion [3]) and under a modified MIT license (following discussion [3]), despite of the fact it is visible on github [4] and can not be hidden (js inside browsers), so perfectly auditable once deminified

Working and usable/used (not by tons of people currently, but used) here: http://peersm.com/peersm

thank you for making this list.

I think the notion of "free/paid" is not only useless, but nocive.  It
does not matter whether the system is available at a fee or not.  What
matters is that the source code is available for review or not.

Another important matter is whether the system is proprietary or free
software: in the former case, users are totally dependent on the trust
of the proprietor of the software, and unable to detect or correct any
flaws they might discover, nor to adapt the software to their own
specific needs, nor to share that software, modified or not, with other
people who might need it--including security fixes, and including for a fee.

Therefore, I would change this column to "Gratis/Paid" to avoid any
confusion, and move it to the end.  In its place I would indicate
whether it's free software (guarantees the four freedoms describes in
the previous paragraph), open source (code is reviewable by the users
and independent parties), or proprietary (code is not available, or only
under NDA).

In a post-Snowden world, not taking this into account amounts to fraud.

Note that software freedom does not apply to services[0].

The Android system uses Linux as its kernel, so it is improper to say
"Android" and "Linux": you should use "Android" and "GNU/Linux" instead
to differenciate the two[1].

Finally, I think you may contribute this (corrected) information to the
Prism-Break project[2].  If you license it under free terms, then other
people would be able to include it in their own derivative works.

Suggest adding LastPass to this list. It was vetted by Steve Gibson. http://blog.lastpass.com/2010/07/lastpass-gets-green-light-from-security.html
